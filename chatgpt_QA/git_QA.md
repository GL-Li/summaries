Monorepo: I have two repos on Bitbuckect, each have their own pipelines. I am creating a new project, which uses the functions in the two repos. As to version control, I want the new repo also has the git info of the two. What is the best strategy to manage these repos?

ðŸ¤–:[ChatGPT4o]
Managing multiple repositories, especially when you want to maintain git histories and potentially synchronize changes across them, can be effectively handled using a 'monorepo' or a 'multirepo' strategy, depending on your specific needs. Since you also want to leverage the functionality present in two existing repositories, itâ€™s valuable to zoom out and evaluate both strategies before deciding on the implementation details.

### Big Picture Considerations:

1. **Monorepo Approach**:
   - A monorepo consolidates all related projects (and their histories) into a single repository. This approach can provide ease in terms of synchronizing changes across projects, sharing common libraries, and potentially unifying your pipeline processes.
   - **Benefits**: Simplified dependency management, easier coordination across teams, consolidated CI/CD pipelines.
   - **Drawbacks**: The repository can become large and complex, tools and workflows may need to be adjusted to handle the increased size.

2. **Multirepo Approach**:
   - Keeping the two repositories separate while creating a new repository for the third project, which includes dependencies on the other two.
   - **Benefits**: Clear separation of concerns, potentially easier to manage smaller repos, lower complexity per repo.
   - **Drawbacks**: Managing cross-repo dependencies, ensuring synchronized changes, multiple CI/CD configurations needed.

3. **Hybrid Approach with Git Submodules or Subtrees**:
   - Use either Git submodules or subtrees to include other repos within a new monorepo. Both approaches allow you to incorporate external repositories into a monorepo while keeping their histories intact.

### Zooming In: Implementation Details

- **Git Submodules**: Submodules track specific commits in another repository and can be good if those projects rarely change or your modifications to them are isolated.

    ```bash
    # Adding a repository as a submodule
    git submodule add https://bitbucket.org/youruser/repo1.git path/to/repo1
    git submodule add https://bitbucket.org/youruser/repo2.git path/to/repo2
    ```

    **Pros**: Keeps super repo clean and individual repo histories are intact.
    
    **Cons**: Requires manual updates and might be tricky for beginners.

- **Git Subtree**: Use during mergers or major dependencies and intend to preserve full history.

    ```bash
    # Adding a repository as a subtree
    git subtree add --prefix=path/to/repo1 https://bitbucket.org/youruser/repo1.git master --squash
    git subtree add --prefix=path/to/repo2 https://bitbucket.org/youruser/repo2.git master --squash
    ```

    **Pros**: Full history integration, less complex branch management.

    **Cons**: Merging changes requires more effort than submodules.

### Next Steps

1. **Evaluate Current Needs**: Consider how frequently your dependencies change, and how tightly coupled these projects are.
2. **Set Up CI/CD**: Regardless of setup, make sure your pipelines are equipped to pull, test, and build each part of your combined setup.
3. **Test and Iterate**: Initially, test with one project to assess any inefficiencies and gauge the effort required for transitions.

Implementing a thorough strategy would depend on weighing the balance between repository independence and the complexity of integration. Let me know if there are other aspects or constraints in your setup.
